# Rekall Tutorials

We provide a few tutorials to get you started with Rekall.
We recommend starting with the Basics Tutorial.
This will walk you through Rekall's basic API and show you how to visualize
Rekall queries with Vgrid.

## Basics
Start with `Basics.md`. This will walk you through downloading a few example
videos and metadata. Then move on to `Basics.ipynb`, where we show you how to
move the metadata into Rekall and visualize it with Vgrid.
